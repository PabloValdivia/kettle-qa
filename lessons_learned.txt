Got lauching docker containers done. Wondering if I should randomize ports incoming
to work around potential collisions on the system running tests.

- Need to file issues with Matt about
1. Renaming dataset groups
2. Renaming datasets
3. The execute unit tests part is throwing a null pointer when I give it anything.
The test name is probably tightly linked to the name of the transform.
Saving As for your transform probably breaks that.  That's not good.

Hoping with the sharp points listed to be able to redo this test.

From the outset, ENVIRONMENT_HOME anchors everything from a central point.
For example, if we create a folder under unitTests called registeredDefects
then said that our ENVIRONMENT_HOME=/home/bjackson/kettle-qa/registeredDefects
the net effect of that is that with the exception of explicitly defining a 
folder to hold CSV files, all folders will line up and the tests, datasets etc.
will be discoverable by the dataset-plugin.


3:43 PM The exported environment is still hardcoded to the machine it was
designed and exported from.  So let us try to use jq to ask for the
present working directory and update that node before maitre.sh imports it.

Matt fixed a few bugs found while setting up the tests.  That cleared the way
to focus on orchestration to some extent.  Thinking I need to set up a few
versions of kettle in containers for regression testing.  Since the plugins
are in flux, I need to make sure the containerized kettle environments will
pick up on the changes.
